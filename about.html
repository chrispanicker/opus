<p>So you want to know more about me? That's cool.</p><br><br>

<p>I'm currently in my final year of Communication Design at Parsons. <br><br> 
	With design, I constantly try to find new ways to make whatever it is that I may be making. I try to think of my work as holistically <change></change> reaching and engaging with people in some capacity.</p><br><br>

<h2>What do I do?</h2>
<p>My coursework at Parsons has included branding, web design, animated short films, 3D art, photography, and video. I also have worked as a freelance designer, photographer, and videographer.</p><br><br>
<p>I work with the Adobe Creative Suite, AutoDesk Maya, Unreal, HTML, CSS, Javascript. </p><br><br>
